        <h4>Normal Alerts</h4>

            <strong>Primary.</strong> You are seeing the primary color. Sweet.
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
            <strong>Secondary.</strong> Still undecided what color this should be. But it's okay. You are using Sass anyway!

        <h4>Alert Headings</h4>
        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
                <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>

                Make your work consistent but not predictable. Never let your guard down by
                thinking you’re good enough. Dedicate yourself to <strong>lifelong</strong> learning.
                A good composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting
                elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space.

                Dedicate yourself to lifelong learning. <strong>Intuition</strong> is important.
                Nothing of value comes to you without working at it. This design is brilliant.
                While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me,
                “When you make something no one hates, no one loves it.”

                If you’re not being honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate
                something meaningful to someone else? Respect your <strong>craft</strong>. Think about all the
                possibilities. Design as if your life depended on it. A good
                composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting...

            <p class="no-margin-bottom">
                Think about all the possibilities. Your rapidograph pens are dried up,
                the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. <strong>Stop</strong> clicking your mouse,
                get messy, go back to the basics and make something original.
                Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly...

                <strong>Someday</strong> is not a day of the week. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything
                requires hard <strong>work</strong>. If you give up, you will achieve nothing.
                The details are not the details. They make the design.

                Intuition is important. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic
                elements on the outside of the left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis.
                This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations.
