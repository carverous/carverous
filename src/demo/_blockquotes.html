                Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,
                the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently
                -- they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them,
                glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them
                because they change things... they push the human race forward,
                and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius,
                because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world,
                are the ones who do.

                Don’t let your past learning stop you from learning new things.
                It’s a simple trap because when we learn new things, the brain tries
                to associate them with familiar things (i.e. stuff you already know)
                and when the new concepts are too different or in contradiction with
                what you already know, this may lead to frustration.
