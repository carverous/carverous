        <h4>Alert Headings</h4>
        <div class="alert alert-default" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Default.</h4>
            <p>
                Design is all about fucking <strong>relationships</strong>—the relationship of form and content,
                the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Paul Rand once said,
                “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect,
                conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-inverse" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Inverse!</h4>
            <p>
                If you fucking give up, you will achieve <strong>nothing</strong>. You need to sit down and sketch more
                fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere.
                What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what.

        <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
                <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>

            <p>
                Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Never let your guard down by
                thinking you’re fucking good enough. Dedicate yourself to <strong>lifelong</strong> fucking learning.
                A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting
                elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space.

        <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Secondary.</h4>
            <p>
                Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. <strong>Intuition</strong> is fucking important.
                Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. This design is fucking brilliant.
                While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me,
                “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Fuck.

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Danger!</h4>
            <p>
                If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate
                something meaningful to someone else? Respect your fucking <strong>craft</strong>. Think about all the
                fucking possibilities. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. A good fucking
                composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Info.</h4>
            <p>
                Think about all the fucking possibilities. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up,
                the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. <strong>Stop</strong> clicking your mouse,
                get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original.
                Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly...

            <h4 class="alert-heading">Success!</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Someday</strong> is not a fucking day of the week. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything
                requires hard fucking <strong>work</strong>. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing.
                The details are not the details. They make the fucking design.
                What’s important is the fucking drive to see a...

        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <h4 class="alert-heading">Warning!</h4>
            <p>
                Intuition is fucking important. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic
                elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis.
                This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations.
