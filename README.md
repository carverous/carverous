## Overview
A responsive front-end framework I built from scratch for my future projects.
Wanna help? That would be cool!

## Questions
Q: Why?<br>
A: Not only for learning purposes, but also to avoid the bloat from other frameworks.
At least I can say that I am using my own creation. This gives me confidence knowing that
I know how it works behind the scenes.

Q: Doest it work in IE?<br>
A: No, not yet.<br>

Q: It's just Bootstrap, right?<br>
A: No. I made my own implementation. However, the method of using the class names should be the same
so I can easily use it as a bootstrap replacement.
