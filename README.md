# Carverous (beta)

## Overview
A mini responsive front-end framework I built for my future use.
Wanna help? That would be cool!

## Purpose
Not only for learning purposes, but also to avoid the bloat from other frameworks
as I don't need all of their features. This also lets me know how it works behind
the scenes and gives me the ability to fix future issues.
