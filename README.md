# Carverous (beta)

## Overview
A responsive front-end framework I started off from scratch.
It is developed having a mobile first approach in mind,
meaning the code is designed to prioritise mobile devices first
and then adjust the components as the screen scales up.
It doesn't require any third-party JS lirbrary.

## Purpose
Not only for learning purposes, but also to avoid the bloat from other frameworks
as I don't need all of their features. This also lets me know how it works behind
the scenes and gives me the ability to fix future issues.
