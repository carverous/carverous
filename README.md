# Carverous (beta)

## Overview
A responsive front-end framework I started off from scratch.
It is developed having a mobile first approach in mind,
meaning the code is designed to prioritise mobile devices first
and then adjust the components as the screen scales up.
It doesn't require any third-party JS library. The scripts are written in ES6 and are transpiled using Babel.

## Purpose
To avoid the bloat from other frameworks as I don't need all of
their features. This also lets me know how stuff work behind the
scenes and gives me the ability to fix future issues.
